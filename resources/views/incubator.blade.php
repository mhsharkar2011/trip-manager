All we need is your contact details and some ideas about your project size, which stage you are in and where you need help with. If you get past our screening, we will send a format where you would have to prepare your materials for the next stage. We would ask for 'Value Proposition Canvas' at the very least.</p>

									<div class="title"><span>What does an ideal project investment look like?</span></div>
									<div class="text">
										<p>
											There is no set rule or recipe of investment. A six month project costing estimated $100,000 could mean $50,000 investment in development and other areas where needed.<br></p>
										
									</div>
								</li>
							
								<li>
									<div class="title"><span>How much steak are we talking about?</span></div>
									<div class="text">
										<p>
											It all depends on valuation and understanding of the project. All we can say is we can work through almost any scenarios. We could take equity, royalty, deferred payments, RSU, or any terms that fit your business. More flexible than an other incubators out there.</p>
										
									</div>
								</li>
							
								<li>
									<div class="title"><span>What industries do you cover?</span></div>
									<div class="text">
										<p>
											We would be happy to cover any industry. However, it has to be software project. We don't do IoT, mechanical, robotics and other projects outside of software development. However, stay tuned for our future initiatives around IoT.</p>
										
									</div>
								</li>
							
								<li>
									<div class="title"><span>Do you provide office space?</span></div>
									<div class="text">
										<p>
											The world is global now. So, location is not important. In light of that, we don't provide office space. However, we may discuss an office space as part of the package which we will plan out together.</p>
